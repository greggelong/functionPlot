# function plot in p5js

A simple sketch to plot math functions on p5 canvas

hope to expand to animate plots and do cobweb plots for iterated functions.  

sketch.js is the simple plotting function


sketch1.js I have added a scaler to zoom into the plot here it is controlled by mouseX

sketch2.js  has separate function for getting values and plotting. in one function  y coordinates of the function are stored in an array and in the plotting function those array values are plotted.
